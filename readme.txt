Starsiege v1.004r 
10/10/20 Update - Standalone

Changes from the 3/14/20 Build include:
* This build now targets Windows 7, 8.1, 10.
* winmm.dll has been replaced with DxWnd for better compatibility.
* addrbook.cs has been added for gameservers not broadcasting to the new master servers.

Special Notes:
* The game now launches in borderless fullscreen, regardless of current monitor resolution, and will scale itself to fit automatically.
* You will want to change your fullscreen resolution to 1 level down from your monitor's native resolution, to prevent font display issues.

Special thanks to:
* surprising_steve for his contributions to the DxWnd config used in this patch.

Install Instructions:
* Remove "winmm.dll"
* Extract contents of .zip file to same folder as Starsiege.exe
