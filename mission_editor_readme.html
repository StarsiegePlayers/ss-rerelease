for STARSIEGE Mission Editor</b></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b>
    The Starsiege mission editor is an unsupported tool for
    advanced users to create their own missions. We have created
    a forum for users to discuss tips, tricks, and ideas, and to
    help users support one another at </font><a
    href="http://www.starsiegeplayers.com"><font size="2"
    face="Courier New">www.starsiegeplayers.com</font></a><font
    size="2" face="Courier New">. You can use the mission editor
    to create single player missions, entire single player
    campaigns, and multiplayer missions. The caveat is that this
    program is most useful for those individuals with programming
    experience. It is not intended to be user-friendly to the
    casual dabbler.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier New"><b>To enable the mission
editor:</b></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Start Starsiege with the
    &quot;-me&quot; argument. If Starsiege is installed to the
    default directory from the windows command prompt, type: c:\dynamix\starisege\starsige.exe
    -me. An available option is to create a shortcut to Starsiege
    and then add the '-me' to the target field. When you create a
    server and enter the mission, the console and mission editor
    will automatically become enabled, and the console will be
    enabled permanently.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Only run the mission
    editor on a local server. When you run Starsiege in mission
    edit mode, do not try to join a game or to play the campaign.
    In this mode, engaging the campaign and vehicle lab
    components could easily crash the game. You should also
    probably make sure time limit is turned off on your server so
    the mission doesn't activate while you are editing. A
    password for your server is also a good idea in order to
    prevent players from entering while you are editing (a good
    way to crash everything).</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Save often. The mission
    editor is infinitely flexible and therefore allows you to
    create situations never anticipated by the designers of
    Starsiege. It is undefined what will happen under such
    situations, so save frequently to minimize data loss in case
    of a crash.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Controls for the camera
    and misc. controls</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Some of the following
    commands are for TED, some are for the mission editor, and
    others move the camera or relate to general functionality.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Courier New"><b>Using TED (Terrain EDitor)--
F4</b></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">TED is the tool for
    editing terrain. It gives you the capacity to completely
    customize a map's terrain. You can even make their own
    terrain tiles. (This process is complex beyond the scope of
    this document, but if you wish to experiment artistically,
    you may indeed change even the terrain tiles.)</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">To access TED: hit F4.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier New"><b>The Controls: </b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><b>[New]</b> </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">New will generate a new
    TED volume according to your preferences. It's often a good
    place to start. Another good starting location is to load an
    already existing mission and edit it. Rename the mission in
    Windows before you start editing since the name cannot be
    changed once you begin. New missions are saved in the
    Starsiege root directory; before editing, you must fully exit
    Starsiege and move the new mission file (.mis file and .ted.vol
    file) to the multiplayer directory.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><strong>To edit pre-existing
    missions:</strong> This only needs to be done if you are
    going to modify the terrain. If you are just making a new
    mission file, changing buildings, adding units,etc, you dont
    have to go through this. Only if you plan to change the
    terrain. Relighting counts as changing the terrain.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">First copy and rename
    the .mis and .ted.vol in the multiplayer dir. DM_City_on_the_Edge.ted.vol
    becomes New_jack_city.ted.vol and do the same with the .mis
    file. Now create a server with the new mission and change the
    ted volume the mission uses. Go to MissionGroup/Volumes/tedVolume
    bring up its inspect window (F2) and change the volume name
    to the new volume name. Now SAVE, then exit. All the way to
    windows, it wont bite. Then restart, Starsiege and you are
    ready to edit both your new mis file and your new ted.vol
    file. See how easy that was.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><b>[Save]</b> </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">When save is pressed,
    two files are saved: the .ted.vol file (the terrain, or TED
    volume); and the .mis file (the mission file, which contains
    all the mission elements).</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><strong>Note: </strong>If
    you change any of the .ted.vol files included with Starsiege
    you may not be able to join other peoples multiplayer games.
    Starsiege may notice that the file on you local machine has
    been changed and not allow you to join a server. Make a
    complete back-up of your multplayer directory in case the
    included missions become broken.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><b>[Relight] </b></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Changes the terrain
    lighting based on the lighting preferences from your
    lightsource (see Planet in &quot;Using the Mission Editor/Sky
    and Planet&quot;).</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><b>[Level x]</b> </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">(where x= a value from 1
    to 6) changes the brush size. You can manipulate large
    numbers of tiles at once using larger brushes. However,
    levels 5 and 6 brushes will bog down machines. Try not to use
    anything larger than level 4. The brush appears as framed
    tiles (though this feature can be changed in the options menu)
    with each tile having a reference line pointing to the corner
    to be affected by location-specific changes (i.e.,
    raiseHeight by 10 will not raise the whole tile into a mesa,
    but will raise that specific corner creating a small pyramid
    with the surrounding tiles). What the brush actually does is
    dependent on the action assigned to it.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><b>[1 - Clumpy Vegetation] (</b>or
other terrain type) </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">This is the terrain type
    that will be applied if you use setTerrainType.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><b>[--Selection Action--]</b>
</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">If you are using &quot;select&quot;
    ascribed to the mouse button and are using selection tiles,
    this pull-down menu will choose the effect to be imposed on
    the current selection.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><b>[Clear Sel]</b> </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">This deselects (clears)
    all the currently selected tiles. You can also choose &quot;deselect&quot;
    to ascribe to a button and deselect tiles one at a time.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><b>[Clear Pin]</b> </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">This clears all pins.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><b>[TED Light]</b></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Same as relight.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><b>[xxxx.bmp]</b> </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">This is the material
    pulldown menu. It chooses the texture of the tile you will
    manually place with the setMaterial command. Orders like GGGG.bmp
    will place grass in all four corners of your selected tile,
    whereas GGBB.bmp will create a blend of half grass and half
    rock. All the textured tiles should match when told to, using
    the command: &quot; LS::ApplyTextures();&quot;.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Example 1: You set a
    GGGG tile against a GGBB tile at the GG side so there is a
    smooth transition from grass to rock. The bad news is that
    not all terrain tiles match all the time and so some have to
    be placed manually like pavement or the cybridy metallic
    texture found on the Pluto maps.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Example 2: I want to
    make a paved road. I click on the material pulldown menu and
    from the menu, I choose rd_p_srt.bmp. (I assume it's a
    straight paved road.) I ascribe &quot;select&quot; to my
    mouse button and select an L shaped group of tiles with the
    mouse, then I click on [--Selection Action-]. From that menu,
    the correct choice is &quot;setMaterial &quot;.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Bam! It replaces all the
    tiles I had selected with the paved road texture, but they
    are all askew. The road didn't follow the L. In fact, some of
    the road doesn't even match up on the same sides of the L.
    Now is the time for LS::ApplyTextures, right?</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Wrong. The road must be
    rotated manually. Ascribe &quot;rotate&quot; to one of the
    mouse buttons and click the tiles that don't match. Rotate
    the ones that should be going north-south in that direction,
    and the ones that should go east-west to line up that way.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Now for the corner.
    Click [Clear Sel] to clear the road selection. Ascribe &quot;select&quot;
    back to the mouse button and click on the tile that should be
    the corner. The corner is a different material than the
    straight road, so from the material list, it should be
    something like rd_p_crn.bmp. Now, with the corner and the
    proper material selected, choose &quot; setMaterial &quot;
    from [--selection action--]. Now isn't a bad time to type
    &quot;LS::ApplyTextures();&quot; into the console. This
    command should transition the road tiles to the surrounding
    dirt, rock, or whatever was there before you chose to lay
    down a road.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Easy, wasn't it? If you
    really want to, you can try and make the road end correctly.
    Did you see rd_p_end.bmp in the texture menu? Enjoy!</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">The convoluted example
    above provides an additional plug for the usefulness of Ctrl+Z
    for undo. Ctrl+C for copy and Ctrl+V for paste are also
    available. Good test use: To lengthen the legs of either side
    of the L shaped road you just made. &quot;Select&quot; a few
    straight road tiles from either part of the L (don't include
    the corner or the end if you put one on) and hit Ctrl+C. Now
    hit Ctrl+V, and wherever you click next will be slathered
    with exactly what you just copied, so copy the new selection
    onto the end of the road. This process can be repeated and
    works with roads (or any material textures) AND elevations,
    meaning you can copy and paste mountains and canyons.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><b>NOTE:</b> Whether you
    are cutting and pasting materials, heights, or both is
    configurable in the options menu.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><b>[mouse]</b> </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">The two boxes to the
    right of the materials box are commands the left mouse
    buttons can be ascribed to. Just right-click on the current
    function and choose a different one if you need it. You have
    two choices for your left-mouse button, so you can toggle
    back and forth between the functions ascribed with a single
    click. I always have one button set to &quot;select&quot; and
    use the other for whatever is necessary, but your preferences
    may differ from mine.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">These actions be
    ascribed to your mouse buttons:</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">What's the solution?
        We should either lower the heights of smaller pieces of

<p><font size="3" face="Courier New"><b>Pinning</b></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Pinning controls how
        many polygons are used to draw a particular piece of
        terrain. The higher number a tile is pinned to the more
        polygons are used to draw the terrain and the more detail
        is visible from further away. Sounds good, right? Just
        &quot;pin&quot; the entire landscape so it's perfectly
        detailed all the time from any distance, right?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Not so fast. There
        are multiple problems. First, not all computers are fast
        enough to draw that many polys. People will get a lousy
        framerate playing your level and blame it on lag. Also,
        one of the concepts that makes the terrain in Starsiege
        work is that the engine wants to draw more distant
        objects with fewer polys. So when it tries to reduce
        areas around a pinned area to fewer polygons, it can miss
        a piece here or there and create &quot;tears&quot; in the
        terrain. Other problems may occur as a side effect of
        pinning, so be careful. This is a VERY powerful tool, but
        it defeats some of the functions that make the terrain
        look fine, and although having access to such a manual
        override can aid world design, it can also cause dramatic,
        undesirable results. Consider yourself warned.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Place your pins
        cautiously. Use as few as necessary to accomplish the
        desired job in an area. Not enough pinning leads to the
        terrain jumping up or down quickly. Too much pinning will
        lead to a poor frame rate on slow machines.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Always use a level 0
        brush to pin. (You only want to pin one tile/point at a
        time.) Minimum and maximum pin detail is set in the
        options menu. Keep in mind you are using both at once. If
        you pin a tile with minimum 1 and maximum 3, the pin is
        set so the pinned tile and all the tiles that depend it
        are drawn at levels 0-3 with the same detail as if always
        drawn at level 1.</font></p>

        of terrain. Consequently, all tunnels are ZED shapes.
        Make sure the shape is set NOT TO snap to terrain. Sink
        it into the ground with [Ctrl+Mouse] and create holes in
        the terrain for the ends to stick out by flagging the
        tiles that need to be holes as Empty1. (Options/ Empty1,
        select tiles that should be empty and use setFlags.)
        Setting the variable $alt = -1000; should be very helpful.

    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">An object named command

    the object number for that object or group. This number can
    be used to identify the object also, but should not be used
    for scripting, only for testing a script command. This number
    is usually the same, but can change each time you load the
    mission. So if I want to see what the &quot;MissionGroup/RedBase/Command
    Center&quot; looks like when it blows up, and it has 1000
    sustainable damage, and the number to the left of the command
    center in the editor view is 8284, I can blow it up by typing

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Each planet has at
        least three different times: day, dusk (twilight), and
        night. The palette in the MissionGroup/world/Palette
        should be set such that it matches the time of day with
        the sky. The format for the palette should be: planet.time.dml.
        Planet is the planet used (Moon, Ice, Pluto, etc.) Time
        is a single letter to match the time of day: d = day, t =
        dusk (twilight), and n =night, followed by the dml
        extension. Consequently, a dusk mission on Mars needs to
        be mars.t.dml. Anything else for this planet and time
        will cause the sky or ground or other objects to use the
        wrong colors in the art.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">MissionGroup/World/Sky
        has a number of adjustable options. Some planets need no
        sky, such as Mercury (where you just want a starfield).
        But some have complex skies. Most should be set correctly
        when a new planet is created but they can be changed
        manually. The size, rotation and panel texture bitmaps
        can be changed if you desire. There is no comprehensive
        instruction, but if you want to experiment, go ahead.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Note that the planet
        needs to match the palette used, or it will obviously
        look wrong. You can have more than one planet if you want,
        but only one should cast shadows. Lens flare is optional.
        The directional and ambient intensities will both affect
        your terrain. It may take several adjustments and
        relighting before you achieve the desired effect.
        Adjusting the red, green and blue values (so that they
        are not equal), you can get a very distinctive hue in
        your lighting. Directional intensity affects the contrast
        between the shadows and lit areas. The highter the
        directional component the darker the shadows and lighter
        the surrounding area. Ambient intensity affects the base
        level brightness of the entire world. The higher the
        ambient component the brighter things will be in general.
        Ambient lighting has a greater effect on objects and on
        the terrain. To see the effects of changing the
        directional and ambient components you will need to
        relight your terrain.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">NOTE: relighting the
        terrain actually effects the .TED.vol file as well as the

        <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Weather effects and
        starfields are completely optional. Note that these both
        affect frame rate. Although you can create an environment
        with rain and snow under five starfields on the moon, not
        only would it look weird, it might make your game less

<p><font size="3" face="Courier New"><b>Creating Sim groups</b></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Sim groups can be
        created by adding from the mission logic menu or by Ctrl+N
        (new group). Sim groups can be nested within other sim
        groups. Sim groups are used for grouping objects together,
        by base, by team, by object type, by whatever game
        variable you desire. They are necessary for some tasks.
        If you want an AI unit to guard a route, for example, put
        the path markers (F3-mission login-path marker) for the
        route in a sim group, then order the unit to guard the
        group. The unit will patrol the closest path marker first,
        and then proceed to the next in the group. When all the
        markers have been patrolled, the unit will return to the
        first one in the group.</font></p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Shape groups are
        cool. They are a way of making many shapes act together.
        The best example of this feature is keying a group of
        shapes to blow up when the main shape is destroyed. When
        the reactor goes, you want the other substations to blow
        up, right? This operation can be done in script, but
        there are tools in the mission editor that will do it for
        you easily. Making these shapes respond to each other is
        making a shape group.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">To make a shape
        group, all you have to do is from mission logic, select
        shape group (F3-mission logic-shape group). In the new
        shape group folder put a shape group rep and the shapes
        you want to affect each other. In the inspect window, use
        the Damage Distribution field to send damage or
        destruction to the &quot;parents.&quot; Parents are the
        objects you want affected.</font></p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">You can drag and
        drop shapes. They can be raised and lowered by holding
        the control key, and rotated by holding the shift key.
        They can also be dropped to the screen center or camera
        center with the [&gt;&gt;TSC] or [&gt;&gt;Cam]
        respectively. Groups or multiple shapes can be
        manipulated by selecting a group on multiple selecting

        <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">These all need to be
        run from a dos prompt. For those of you who don't know,
        way back in the early days of computing, there was some
        typing involved. I know you nay-sayers don't believe this,
        but imagine how aghast your children are going be when
        you tell them you had to use a mouse in your day.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Usage: I want to
        change the mount size on the Avengers hardpoints. vtlist
        *.cs scripts.vol shows a file in scripts.vol named
        datTank_rb_aven.cs. I extract: extract datTank_rb_aven.cs
        and make the necessary changes. Now I don't need to
        volumize the file again, since Starsiege will only used
        the volumized version if there is not one extracted. If I
        want to, though, I can put the new file back into the
        volume by using VT: vt scripts.vol datTank_rb_aven.cs.</font></p>
